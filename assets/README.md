# Assets Folder

## Product Screenshot

To complete the hero section, add your product screenshot here:

**File:** `product-screenshot.png`

**Recommended specs:**
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Dimensions: 1200x800px or similar 3:2 ratio
- Content: Screenshot of the Analysis Results page showing the risk assessment, tabs, and key features
- Quality: High resolution for retina displays

**How to add:**
1. Take a screenshot of your app.html Analysis Results page (the second image you shared)
2. Save it as `product-screenshot.png` in this folder
3. The landing page will automatically display it in the hero section

**Fallback:**
If the image is not found, the hero section will gracefully hide the image container on mobile and show only the text content.
